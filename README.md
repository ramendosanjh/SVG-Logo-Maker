# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This assingment builds a Node.js command-line application which takes in user input and then generates a logo and saves it as
an [SVG file]. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide a 3 letter text for the logo, 
and then save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file after answering a series of short questions.
